This repository contains documentation about and links to datasets collected by Netrics Internet measurement devices which the Internet Equity research team at the Data Science Institute deployed across Chicago starting in 2021. Supporting resources to assist those that want to use the data are also available.

This repository is organized as follows:
- **documentation**: Find documentation about the data, the deployment of Netrics devices, and the pipeline that moves data from devices to a central data store.
- **example-notebooks**: Find Jupyter notebooks with example code for working with the Netrics data.
- **netrics-data-releases**: Find information about Netrics data releases, including links where you can download the data.
